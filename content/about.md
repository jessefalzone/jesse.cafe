### Interests

I'm a curious person by nature so I have lots of interests. Here are a few:

- 90s computing (e.g. Windows 95)
- Traditional hand-tool woodworking
- Semantic HTML
- Exploring old graveyards
- Environmental protection
- Watches
- Various [90s aesthetics](https://www.are.na/evan-collins-1522646491/channels)
- Baking bread and pizza
- The ocean
- [Solar power](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/)
- German beer
- Hiking

Maybe someday I'll blog about those.

## About This Site

This site is my small contribution to the free and open internet. Originally I
set out to create a simple resume page, but I came across some awesome personal
blogs that inspired me to have a go at writing down my thoughts. I found most of
them through [the 250KB Club](https://250kb.club/) and
[the 512KB Club](https://512kb.club/). They're like-minded people who feel the
web has become too bloated and want to prioritize performance and accessibility.

### Tech

I built jesse.cafe with a Rust library called [Zola](https://getzola.org) and it
is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). My goal is to
make each page as small and fast as possible. There are no bloated CSS or
JavaScript libraries.

The only JavaScript is a small snippet on the [Contact](@/contact.md) page that
hides my email address from bots. Feel free to disable JavaScript! I might
remove this in the future.

I did my best to adhere to best practices and respect visitors. It's a living
document, so I'm always tweaking and improving. Below are a few highlights so
far.

#### Performance

It's fast.

- [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-jesse-cafe/w4vhakv0yw?form_factor=desktop)
- [Yellow Lab Tools report](https://yellowlab.tools/result/gwxqdi0scw)

Most images in the blog are in WebP format at 50% quality to keep file sizes
low. You can click on an image to see it in full quality and in the original
format.

#### Sustainability

The carbon footprint is low.

- [Website Carbon](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/jesse-cafe/)
- [Ecograder](https://ecograder.com/report/rWv0s51g4yZ9VbMWNV75FAcX)
- Hosted using
  [green energy](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjesse.cafe).

width="200px" height="95px">

#### Security and Privacy

- There are no
  [trackers](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=jesse.cafe&device=desktop&location=us&force=false),
  cookies, or ads.
- I've added the recommended
  [security headers](https://securityheaders.com/?q=jesse.cafe&followRedirects=on).
- It's
  [HTTPS-only](https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan/6556cbec-1297-4a12-ad89-c75849a45ddf/technology).

### Styling and Other Choices

#### Domain Name

I chose the `.cafe` top-level domain to reflect the early internet's utopian
ideals of community, accessibility, and the free exchange of ideas. Also I like
coffee.

#### Favicon

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033-->

<img src="/icon.svg" alt="This site's favicon, a desktop icon."
width="128" height="128">

The favicon is an SVG of a desktop icon from Windows 95. As I intend to use this
site as a creative outlet, and I have a similar
[Luxo lamp](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxo_Jr._(character)>) on my desk, I
thought it was fitting.

#### Color and Font

The color scheme is loosely based on [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/)
(especially dark mode). Light/dark mode follows your system preference.

The
[font stack](https://github.com/system-fonts/modern-font-stacks?tab=readme-ov-file#old-style)
for regular text is
`'Iowan Old Style', 'Palatino Linotype', 'URW Palladio L', P052, serif`. I had
planned to use Lucida Grande but it's not available on enough systems, and I
have a renewed appreciation for serif fonts. Monospace fonts are
`ui-monospace, 'Cascadia Code', 'Source Code Pro', Menlo, Consolas, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace`.
There are no external fonts that would slow down page load.

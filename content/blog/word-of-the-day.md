I don't know why I waited so long to use
[Apple Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios)!
They're great for automating darn near anything on an Apple device.

Apple's gallery of shortcuts has a "Word of the Day" automation to open
Merriam-Webster's
[Word of the Day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day) feed, but I
thought the text was too small and poorly formatted. I created my own simple
version that injects some CSS to bump up the font-size and provides light and
dark color schemes that match my device setting.

If you're interested, you can
[grab the shortcut here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6156e7e752734854a1c84faf1174e0a4).
